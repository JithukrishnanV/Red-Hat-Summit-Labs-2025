## 🔒 Lab 1: Secure CI/CD Pipeline Transformation  
**Title:** LB1004 - Secure CI/CD Pipeline Transformation with Jenkins and Red Hat’s Advanced Developer Suite (RHADS)  

This lab demonstrates how to **transform an insecure pipeline into a Trusted Software Supply Chain**, using:  
- **Red Hat OpenShift**  
- **Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)**  
- **RHADS Security Tools**: Sigstore/Cosign, SonarQube, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (ACS), Trusted Profile Analyzer (TPA)  

### ✅ Key Learnings  
- Enforced **signed commits** & **signed container images**  
- Generated & attested **Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs)**  
- Integrated **SonarQube** for static code analysis  
- Used **ACS** for vulnerability scanning & policy enforcement (e.g., 0-Trusted Signature Policy)  
- Validated deployments with **Enterprise Contract CLI (ec)** + Cosign  
- Achieved **SLSA Level 3** pipeline security  

💡 *Result: Developers build as usual, while security guardrails are transparently enforced across the SDLC.*  



## 🚀 Lab 2: OpenShift AI Labs – Deploying Private LLMs  

This lab focused on deploying and managing **Large Language Models (LLMs)** securely on **OpenShift AI**.  

### 👥 Role-Based Hands-On Activities  
#### 🔧 Platform Engineers  
- Built scalable **Model-as-a-Service** infrastructure  
- Managed **model versioning & lifecycle**  
- Exposed models securely via **API gateway + observability**  

#### 👩‍💻 AI Developers  
- Connected dev tools (e.g., Continue) to private LLM endpoints  
- Built apps & agents without worrying about GPUs  

#### ⚙️ DevOps Engineers  
- Leveraged **agentic AI + MCP servers** to interact with clusters  
- Automated workflows & integrated with collaboration tools like **Slack**  

#### 📊 Technical Decision Makers  
- Tracked usage with **API analytics & reporting**  
- Optimized **infra costs** by using smaller/specialized models  
- Balanced **innovation & efficiency** with secure deployment practices  

💡 *Result: Hands-on path to scaling AI responsibly with **centralized model management, cost efficiency, and secure access.***
